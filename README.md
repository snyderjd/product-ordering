=============== Practice: Product Ordering ===============

Your task is to simulate a product listing page like you would find on Etsy, Amazon, or Ebay. This application should implement the following features.

1. Display an individual product component. Each product should have a title, short description, price, quantity, and an image.

2. Display the application information in a navigation bar at the top of the page.
    i. The name of the company - Betsy
    ii. Three links: Categories, Orders, and Log Out (these links won't actually do anything, you're just practicing making the navigation bar a component)

3. Display a review list component that contains a maximum of 3 product review components beneath a product. You can use hipster ipsum for the reviews themselves.
